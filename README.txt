= DataCleaner

DataCleaner is a library to aid you in anonymising your data, for example when attempting to reproduce a bug in development, and only live data will do, but it's not safe to have a whole database of customer names, email, etc on your development machine.

DataCleaner wants to make sure your data still looks real, and importantly, passes any validation your code might have. To achieve this it provides a DSL for you to specify the format of the data, along with helpers (using the faker gem) to generate common data.

Only data that need anonymising needs to be specified, foreign keys, non-customer-identifiable data should be left alone.

== Installation

gem install data_cleaner

== Usage
  
  require 'rubygems'
  require 'data_cleaner'
  
  class TopSecret
    attr_accessor :name, :email, :reference, :secret, :date
    
    def initialize(name, email, reference, secret, date)
      @name = name
      @email = email
      @reference = reference
      @secret = secret
      @date = date
    end
    
    def valid?
      name.match(/^[a-z]+ [a-z]+$/i) &&
      reference.match(/^[a-z]{3}[0-9]{1,5}$/) &&
      date.is_a?(Time) || false
    end
    
  end
  
  module DataCleaner::Formats
    helper :embarrassing_secret do
      "I like " + ["the colour pink", "programming PHP", "Judas Priest"].sample
    end
    
    format "TopSecret" do |f|
      f.name [:first_name, " ", :last_name]
      f.email :email, &:name # passes the objects name to the email method
      f.reference do |obj| # one off helper
        "#{obj.name[0..2].downcase}#{obj.date.strftime("%y")}"
      end
      f.secret :embarrassing_secret
    end
  end
  
  secret = TopSecret.new("Matthew Sadler", "mat@foo.com", "mat09", "I like kittens", Time.now)
  puts secret.inspect
  puts "is valid? #{secret.valid?}"
  puts
  
  clean = DataCleaner::Cleaner.clean!(secret)
  
  puts clean.inspect
  puts "is valid? #{clean.valid?}"

prints:
  
  #<TopSecret:0x1015f7830 @email="mat@foo.com", @date=Mon Jan 17 16:53:19 +0000 2011, @name="Matthew Sadler", @secret="I like kittens", @reference="mat09">
is valid? true
